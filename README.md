# GrayRESNET101-TPU
This repository contains the modified code to pretrain ResNet101 architecture on the entire ImageNet dataset using grayscale images only.
The idea behind pretraining ResNet101 using only grayscale images is that it will be helpful for medical images. Any deep learning model applied to medical images can use this pretrained ResNet101 for efficient and better feature extraction as proposed by this paper: [Pre-Training on grayscale ImageNet improves medical image classification](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCVW_2018/papers/11134/Xie_Pre-training_on_Grayscale_ImageNet_Improves_Medical_Image_Classification_ECCVW_2018_paper.pdf)
